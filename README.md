## Updates:

2.2: Lots of bug fixes, implemented more sampling functionality, as well as implementing support for Apple (Metal) and better AMD support, also improved performance and implemented automatic handling of version changes.

2.1: Mostly bug fixes following asset release on the asset library

2.0: Rebuilt from the ground up to use the compositor system, improving performance and visuals.

## Features
* Fully volumetric clouds, extendable as far from the camera as you want with the correct settings
* Easy Setup (besides getting the addon installed it comes down to like 3 clicks)
* Performant (I use resolution options with upscaling and depth handling, allow for soft clouds at low resolution you can still fly through)
* Soft visuals, or cartoony, styling options allows for a wide range of options
* Entirely procedural, or paint in clouds using the editor tools, able to paint in density as well as color to tint clouds differently depending on region

## Installation

1. Download either here or in the asset library by searching for "Sunshine Clouds 2"
2. Activate Plugin (Project->Project Settings->Plugins->SunshineClouds2)
3. Add a SunshineCloudsDriverGD node to your scene
4. Ensure your scene has a World Environment present in it
5. Press "Generate Clouds Resource" button in the driver
6. Add a directional light to the "Tracked Directional Lights" array on the driver
7. Have fun!
